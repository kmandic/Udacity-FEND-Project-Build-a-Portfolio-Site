# Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree

## Part 1: Web Foundations

### Project 2: Build a Portfolio Site

- This project is a part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. It is uploaded on GitHub as a separate repository for grading purposes.
- I've decided not to use any framework like Bootstrap so I can practice coding with plain HTML and CSS.

- Site can be seen on [GitHub pages](https://kmandic.github.io/Udacity-FEND-Project-Build-a-Portfolio-Site/).
